a google fusion table map of the top crash cluster location in MA currently the code is an absolute mess

###TODO###

* sort through it and figure out what sort of license I can put this under
* clean up the obviously horrible bits of it, IE all the extraneous comments
* clean it up in less obvious ways, IE make it DRYer
* improve it, possibly queriable styles to start ?
